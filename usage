Available options are:
-Trace			verbose debug
-Daemon			became as daemon
-Log somedir		name of log directory in Log/somedir
-VodDir somedir		default /cache/
-HttpPort number	default 80
-ConfigUrl http[s]://[[user]:[pass]@]host[:port]/[path/]file.xml

-ssl_port number		default 0, http is disabled if ssl is enabled
-ssl_cert file.crt		certificate
-ssl_cert_key file.key		certificate key
-ssl_cert_key_pass file.pw	the file with a password if passphrase is required

For config is use xml
as simple tag
<line option="val"/>
or full tag
<line option="val">
</line>

It can usage local or remote config
Local config use from same dir and have name AvProxy.xml
Remote config setup from startup options -ConfigUrl

Local config is not update under windows, only restart AvProxy reload it
for update local config under linux use `kill -SIGUSR1 pid`
Remote config is update some time

All input and output will reconfigure when remote config changed
For update config just change (increase) ver number in xml config Ver="1"

example config AvProxy.xml

The Url for inputs are unique and must present
The Name for outputs are unique and must present
They will ignore a double Input Url in config 

And the Name of Output use for access to stream through url http[s]://

http streaming outputs available through 
http[s]://hostname/live/Name

http live streaming (hls) outputs available by extension .m3u8
http[s]://hostname/live/Name/index.m3u8

Pnr uses to take stream program
Will take first program from a stream if no Pnr define

There are input schemes:
http -  http:// and https:// for ssl
hls - m3u8:// and m3u8s:// for ssl
rtp - rtp://
udp - udp://

"Desc" uses for description info in playlist.m3u8, will use as Name if no define 
"Bandwidth" uses for HLS variant to choose default bandwidth, value in kbps
AES128=1 enable AES-128 for HLS output

ApplePreroll=N at output section - preroll N segments for output hls
by default 3 segments present at output playlist
as example in AvProxy.xml
ApplePreroll=10 keep 10 segments

AppleDuration=N at output section - split HLS segments by duration
value in milliseconds, by default 10000 ms, less than 2000 ms will ignore

AppleIDRLimit=N at output section - split HLS segments by IDR frame
value in milliseconds, by default 8000 ms, less than 1000 ms will ignore

Average IDR and IDR history of last frames from ingress stream, availible from stats
You able to learn how to set own AppleDuration and AppleIDRLimit for better split HLS segments

All of the outputs are available through http[s]://hostname/live/playlist.m3u8 as playlist

For configure simple VOD
#mkdir some_root_dir
#copy /mnt/file_in_some_root_dir.mp4 some_root_dir
#AvProxy -VodDir some_root_dir

All of a files in some_root_dir available through http[s]://hostname/vod/playlist.m3u8 as playlist
or direct access http[s]://hostname/vod/file_in_some_root_dir.mp4

This is basic file access, no zero copy or else like remux, will improve in future

To access the users page follow http[s]://hostname/users

To access inputs/outputs live stats use http[s]://hostname/live/stats

All inputs are active after start
